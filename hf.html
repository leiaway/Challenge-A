		<div class="box f">	<br> From 1916 to 1970, 6 million+ African Americans migrated from the South to the North, West, and East. African Americans migrated to begin a new life and to build places for themselves. They got bearded with racial discrimination for tryong to create an urban culture economically, socially, and politically. In the North, Blacks would get payed 3 times more then the Black factory workers from the South. By 1919, 1 million African-Americans had fleeted the South. They would transport by train, boat, and bus. Females had the hardest time getting jobs. As of 2017, 7.5% of the U.S. are unemployed African-Americans. The median usual weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers that were Black women were $657. </div>

		<div class="box h"> <br> 1900, 9 out of 10 black Americans lived in the South. Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and New York City, absorbed the large numbers of migrants. Around WWII, migrants moved more to Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. Some blacks were lucky to purchase land, become sharecroppers, tenant farmers, or farm laborers. Some parts of the economy called for more workers for the Pennsylvania Railroad and paid for the travel expenses of 12,000 afro people. Meaning the employers were so desperate that they hired afro people. Illinois Central Railroad, steel mills, factories, and tanneries, provided free railroad passes also. The main causing of the great migration included lynching, an unfair legal system, inequal education, and denial of suffrage. </div>
