		<div class="box f">	<br> A book and movie under the title, &#x22; The Hate U Give &#x22; , is a plain example of police brutality. A character named Khalil is shot dead by a white police officer as the 17-year-old boy reaches for a hairbrush. The investigating police seek to blame the victim, and by association Starr, meaning that the detectives are trying to find ways to make the victim guilty of what happened; if not, they &#8217 ll try to include anyone else who was associated with the event. The author Angie Thomas said, &#x22; It is important to speak up and speak out, especially in moments of injustice. &#x22; </div>

Police that have been put on trial for being accused as guilty are very rare. The main reason why justice isn &#8217 t getting served in our black communities is due to the fact that they are in a battlefield where your every move will be watched. Black people in these impoverished and crime-ridden neighborhoods in the United States do not feel safe coming forward. Angie Thomas has also said, &#x22; Not snitching is a survival tactic &#x22;. </div>
		<div class="box h"> <br> Police Brutality within the U.S. is properly defined as the unwarranted or excessive and often illegal use of force against civilians by U.S. police officers. Assault and battery (e.g., beatings) to mayhem, torture, harassment, and murder are the different types of police brutality. Afro people weren &#8217 t the only ones that have experienced police brutality. If you weren &#8217 t Caucasian, then you were colored and all colored people throughout U.S. History which we now call &#x22; minorities &#x22;, have been getting the same mistreatment for decades. (Hispanics have been called rapists and job stealers. Muslims have been called terrorists.) Racism is thought to be a major cause of police brutality directed at African Americans.</div>
