		<div class="box f">	<br> Gentrification mostly has effects on the nation &#8217 s biggest cities. More than 1000 neighborhoods in 935 cities/towns have experienced gentrification between 2000 & 2013. 230 of the neighborhoods have higher rents, higher property values, and higher taxes that have caused 135,000+ residents to move out. New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Baltimore, San Diego, and Chicago are cities that are accountable for about half of gentrification nationally. As of 2013, L.A. has a total of 2922 tracts, 512 eligible tracts, 73 gentrified tracts, and was 14% gentrified (tracts: a large area of land). A place that has been gentrified: Lincoln Temple United Church of Christ, a staging ground for the 1963 Civil Rights March on Washington. </div>
		<div class="box g"> Downtown L.A. has been in the gentrification process for more than a decade. Cities in the South Bay area that has been gentrified: Venice, Playa Vista, Arlington Heights, Westlake, and Highland Park. Jefferson Park and West Adams are in the early phases of gentrification because of the metro lines running through them. City Terrace, Cypress Park, Inglewood, and Wrigley are just some of the neighborhoods that are pushing forward new plans that is encouraging gentrification. If you purchase a home in these areas at the beginning of them getting gentrified, it will cost way less than the 1 million price people will be paying soon. Between 1990 and 2015, L.A. County gentrified neighborhoods have increased by 16%. San Diego has 18% gentrified from 1990 - 2015. Orange County is disadvantaged to gentrification by 43%. </div>
		<div class="box h"> <br> Nipsey Hussle was working towards his neighborhood not to get gentrified(Hyde Park area). NFL stadium and NBA arena is getting built-in Inglewood. Developers are buying up properties and pushing out people who have been living there for years. Tenants have already been told that their rent will increase by more than double when there hasn&#8217t been any offers of improvement in their homes or apartments. When places are not raising the rent, tenants are given a 60-day notice to move out for the new owners to come in. There is no rent control/stabilize laws due to our Capitalist system. A next-door resident to the stadium construction site has received a notice that her monthly rent will go from $1,145 to $2,725 for just a two-bedroom apartment. Blacks and Latinos make up 93% of Inglewood&#8217s population, but that will change once the city finishes getting gentrified.</div>

<h1> Hopefully, Mayor James T. Butts is helping the gentrifying problem by capping rent increase at 5% and put a hold on evictions until the city council can get a greater solution. &#x22; And so another historically black neighborhood in Los Angeles gets whitewashed and those who have lived there the longest are powerless to stop it.&#x22; - Monique Judge.</h1>
